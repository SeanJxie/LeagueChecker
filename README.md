# LeagueChecker
By scraping https://op.gg/, the program retrieves information about a player via their user name.

- I'll always be working on this as the project is ment to improve my web scrape programming.

# Usage
- Uses ```Urllib``` and ```bs4``` so ```pip``` installing these two libraries is required.
- Run with Python 3 in any IDE.
